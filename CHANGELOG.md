### Known Knowns
The following are known issues identified in the current release:
* **Email Template Issues:**
  * The `verified_credential_approved.html` email template does not populate the "wallet" value as expected.
  * The `decline_registration.html` email template is triggered when a customer utilizes the self-decline feature.
* **Autosetup Feature Limitation:**
  * The autosetup feature lacks support for service providers and app providers to automatically retrieve customer connector configuration details such as `authURL`, `WalletURL`, etc.
* **Deletion Support Deficiencies:**
  * The deletion of technical users from external providers is currently not supported.
  * Removal of BDRS (BPN-DID Resolver Service) entries is currently not supported.
  * Deletion of wallet tenants has not been implemented.
* **Obsolete Code:**
  * Redundant backend code from a previous version of the SSI implementation remains in the codebase and has not been purged.
* **Code quality Finding:**
  * A potential null reference for 'identityProviderLinks' has been identified, indicating that it could be null on at least one execution path. [#694](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/issues/694)
* **Validation Limitations:**
  * Pattern validation for URL inputs in `POST` and `PUT` endpoints is currently limited, potentially allowing invalid URLs to be accepted. [#587](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/issues/587)
* **Validation of File Upload Limitation:**
  * It is recommended to make use of an existing trustworthy 3rd party virus-scan service for a more broad scan for known malicious signatures. [#779](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/portal-backend/issues/779)
* **In Memory Storage Limitation**:
  * Sensitive information (such as passwords) is read in an unencrypted manner in memory.

### Technical Support
* Removed configuration values needed for the process identity - identity needed for the process worker is now done with a database request to get the needed values for the specified user
* Updated claims to include/set identityType and companyId
* Refactored the IdentityService implementation - IdentityData is read asynchronously from the database which is triggered by the respective policy in the controller. This avoids unnecessary accesses to the database in case only the identity_id or no identity-data at all is required to execute the respective business-logic
* Adjusted the path for portal backend dbaccess in the maintenance docker image
* Identity Service is now created only once per request to minimize database access
* Updated Swagger document schema - nullable and fix values updated
* IdentityService has been refactored using claims preferred_username or clientId from token querying the database for identityId or (for service_accounts) clientClientId instead of UserEntityId. As a fallback (for inconsistent test-data) the previous logic (using claim sub + UserEntityId) still exists. Code that makes use of UserEntityId or (ServiceAccount) ClientId has been refactored to use IdentityId and ClientClientId instead. The (now obsolete) ServiceAccountSync-process has been removed.
* Removed obsolete UserEntityId != null condition from queries being used in authorization
* Fixed security vulnerability for referenced external packages
* Updated dependencies file and file header template
* Updated the Newtonsoft.Json package to fix a high security finding

* Nuget Packages - provide Framework Packages as Nuget Packages
* Added scripts for an easy nuget package creation and update process
* Updated release workflow to not run release workflow when a new framework version is getting published
* Email Service - updated implementation of the email service allowing the configuration of the sender's email address to enable customization of the sender information for outgoing emails
* Changed portal-cd references to portal due to repository renaming
* Updated link to dockerfile in docker-notice files
* Updated README.md
  * mentioned `docs` folder in portal-assets repository
  * referenced docker notice files in notice section instead duplicating the content

### Bugfix

* fixed inner exception handling of the new error handling method implementation of 1.7.0 which resulted in a infinity loop
* endpoint POST /api/administration/registration/applications/{applicationId}/decline
  * fixed backend logic by setting the idp connection of the company to 'disabled' inside the IdP (keycloak)
  * fixed backend logic by fetching the user email upfront to deactivating the user
* disabled the duplicate bpn check for endpoint /api/registration/application/{applicationId}/companyDetailsWithAddress
